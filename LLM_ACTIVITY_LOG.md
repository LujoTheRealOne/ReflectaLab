# LLM Activity Log - ReflectaLab

This file records all important changes and implementations made by the LLM assistant.


*This log file should be updated after every significant LLM implementation.*

## 2025-08-24

- **Fixed Authentication Consistency Issues**: Completely overhauled authentication state management to provide smooth user experience:
  * **Enhanced useAuth Hook**: 
    - Added timeout handling (10s) for user account loading to prevent infinite loading states
    - Implemented exponential backoff retry logic for Firebase authentication failures
    - Added comprehensive error state management with user-friendly messages
    - Created fallback user account creation to prevent blocking when Firestore fails
    - Added proper cleanup of timeouts and retry mechanisms on component unmount
    - Improved state synchronization between Clerk and Firebase authentication
  * **Improved Navigation State Management**: 
    - Simplified navigation keys to reduce unnecessary stack resets
    - Added dedicated error screens with retry functionality
    - Implemented proper loading states for both authentication and user data
    - Removed blocking user account loading that could cause infinite loading
    - Added graceful handling of network failures and timeouts
  * **Enhanced Security & Error Handling**: 
    - Added input validation for authentication tokens and API configurations
    - Improved error messages with specific handling for network and token errors
    - Added proper response validation for token exchange operations
    - Enhanced logging with security-conscious debug information
    - Implemented proper error recovery mechanisms
  * **Professional Code Structure**: 
    - Organized state variables with clear comments and sections
    - Added comprehensive TypeScript types for all authentication states
    - Implemented proper cleanup patterns for all async operations
    - Added computed authentication states for better navigation decisions
  * **Result**: Authentication now handles edge cases gracefully, provides clear error feedback, and never blocks users indefinitely. The app provides a smooth authentication experience even with poor network conditions or service failures.

- **Fixed Login Screen Flash Issue**: Eliminated the bad UX of showing login screen before redirecting to home for authenticated users:
  * **Enhanced Splash Screen Management**: 
    - Modified App.tsx to keep splash screen visible until Clerk authentication is fully loaded
    - Reduced splash screen timeout from 2s to 500ms after auth state is determined
    - Prevents premature hiding of splash screen during auth initialization
  * **Improved Authentication State Logic**: 
    - Enhanced isAuthReady computation to wait for both Clerk and Firebase auth states
    - Added comprehensive authentication state checks before showing navigation
    - Implemented conservative auth state management to prevent false negatives
  * **Optimized Navigation Flow**: 
    - Return null from Navigation component until auth is fully ready (keeps splash visible)
    - Removed blocking user account loading that caused additional loading screens
    - Allow authenticated users to proceed to app while user data loads in background
  * **Enhanced Debug Logging**: 
    - Added detailed console logs for authentication state changes
    - Improved debugging capabilities for authentication flow issues
  * **Result**: App now opens directly to the correct screen (home for authenticated users, login for non-authenticated) without any intermediate flashing or loading screens. Provides a smooth, professional app startup experience.

## 2025-08-24 (Previous)

  * All status icons use consistent colors: white in dark mode, black in light mode

- Switched `screens/CoachingScreen.tsx` from `useAudioTranscriptionAv` (expo-av) to `useAudioTranscription` (expo-audio) to enable real-time microphone input metering for the recording indicator. No UI changes, only hook swap. The `AudioLevelIndicator` now reflects actual levels via `recorderState.metering` with normalization and graceful fallback.

- Fixed keyboard behavior in CoachingScreen: When the text input is focused and user starts voice recording, the keyboard now stays open instead of dismissing. Applied to `handleMicrophonePress`, `handleRecordingCancel`, and `handleRecordingConfirm` functions using `isChatInputFocused` state and delayed focus restoration.

  * Added intelligent keyboard focus management - preserves and restores focus during recording
  * Implemented SpinningAnimation during transcription phase
  * Added clean recording UI with audio level indicator and cancel/confirm buttons
  * Switched from `useAudioTranscriptionAv` to `useAudioTranscription` for real-time audio level metering

  * Added debug logging for progress tracking

- **Ensured Premium Bypass for Initial Compass Access**: Enhanced CompassStoryScreen to properly bypass premium requirements for onboarding:
  * Added detailed debug logging when `fromOnboarding: true` parameter is passed
  * Confirmed premium paywall is bypassed for first-time compass access after deep dive
  * Users can view their initial compass results without premium subscription requirement

- **Fixed Meditation Screen Exit Behavior**: Corrected navigation logic when user exits app during meditation:
  * Updated `canNavigateToChat()` function in `hooks/useOnboardingProgress.ts` to properly handle step 15 (meditation preparation screen)
  * Removed incorrect logic that allowed navigation to main app when onboarding steps were completed but onboarding wasn't officially finished
  * Now only allows chat navigation for step 17 (OnboardingChat) or when `completedAt` timestamp exists
  * Fixed issue where exiting during meditation would redirect to home screen instead of returning to step 15 (meditation preparation)
  * Users now properly resume from meditation preparation screen (step 15) when they exit during meditation, allowing them to restart meditation process

- **Fixed View Insights Button**: Corrected function errors in SettingsScreen.tsx:
  * Fixed undefined variable `initialized` → `rcInitialized`
  * Fixed undefined function `presentPaywallIfNeeded` → `presentPaywall`
  * Removed unused `currentOffering` parameter
  * Button now properly navigates to CompassStory screen for Pro users

  * Confirmed save status icons are properly themed - black (#000000) in light mode, white (#ffffff) in dark mode
  * Placeholder text disappears automatically when user starts typing (built-in TipTap behavior)
  * All UI elements now properly respect system theme changes

- **UI Refinements and Cleanup**: Final polish for better user experience:
  * Increased save status icon opacity to 0.8 in light mode for better visibility (was 0.4, too faint)
  * Centered chat and settings icons in navbar with justifyContent and alignItems center alignment
  * Removed TipTap placeholder extension completely - clean editor with no placeholder text

  * **Solution in `TipTap.tsx`**: Added WebView bridge safety polyfill to prevent undefined object access:
    ```typescript
    // WebView bridge safety check - prevent webkit messageHandlers errors in DOM context
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && !window.webkit) {
      window.webkit = {
        messageHandlers: {
          ReactNativeWebView: {
            postMessage: () => {
              console.warn('WebView postMessage called in DOM context - ignoring');
            }
          }
        }
      } as any;
    }
    ```
  * **Added Error Boundary Protection**: Created `EditorErrorBoundary.tsx` component to catch and handle editor errors gracefully

  * **Impact**: Prevents production crashes, improves app stability, maintains journal functionality even if editor encounters errors

- **Improved Onboarding Event Naming for PostHog Clarity**: Changed from generic to specific event names for each onboarding step:
  * **Before**: Single `onboarding_step_completed` event with `step_name` property differentiation
