# LLM Activity Log - ReflectaLab

This file records all important changes and implementations made by the LLM assistant.


*This log file should be updated after every significant LLM implementation.*

## 2025-08-24

- **Added Year Display to Home Screen**: Enhanced the date display section in HomeContent.tsx:
  * Added year display above the existing weekday/month/day display
  * Extracted year from the same `displayDate` used for other date components
  * Added `yearText` style with small font (12px), bold weight (600), reduced opacity (0.6), and negative margin for proper spacing

  * Added calendar icon button next to "Journal Entries" title in drawer header
  * Installed and integrated `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` dependency
  * Created bottom sheet modal with calendar picker for date selection
  * Implemented date selection logic to navigate to entries for chosen date
  * If entry exists for selected date, navigates to that entry
  * If no entry exists for selected date, creates new entry opportunity
  * Added proper TypeScript types and error handling
  * Includes haptic feedback and smooth modal animations
  * Compatible with both iOS and Android date picker styles
  * Enhanced modal layout with proper positioning, handle bar, shadows, and safe area support
  * Improved UX with backdrop touch handling and proper modal animations
  * Fixed calendar layout positioning and styling for better user experience

- **Repositioned Microphone Button with Keyboard Animations**: Enhanced microphone button UX in HomeContent.tsx:
  * Moved microphone button from bottom navbar to floating right-side position
  * Created round, floating design with shadow and elevation effects
  * Implemented smooth animations that respond to keyboard visibility
  * When keyboard appears: button animates smoothly above keyboard
  * When keyboard hides: button returns to right side, slightly above navbar
  * Added proper z-index layering and touch handling
  * Maintained all existing recording functionality and disabled states
  * Used React Native Reanimated for performant, smooth animations
  * Fixed keyboard behavior: navigation elements now hide when keyboard opens
  * Lowered microphone button position above keyboard (20px gap instead of 80px)
  * Improved UX by preventing navigation interference during text input
  * Removed navbar container styling (borders, shadows, background) for cleaner appearance
  * Fine-tuned microphone button positioning: positioned much lower when keyboard open (80px above keyboard) with consistent 2px right padding in both states
  * Fixed microphone button visibility issue when keyboard opens
  * Optimized positioning for better accessibility and visual consistency

- **Fixed Editor Text Wrapping and Layout**: Resolved horizontal overflow issues in TipTap editor:
  * Added proper word-wrap and overflow-wrap properties to editor styles in TipTap.tsx
  * Implemented max-width constraints and box-sizing for proper container behavior
  * Enhanced CSS in tiptap.css with comprehensive text wrapping rules for all content types
  * Added specific handling for long URLs, code blocks, and links to prevent horizontal scrolling
  * Updated HomeContent container styles to properly constrain editor width
  * Fixed TypeScript typing issues with CSS properties
  * Text now properly wraps within screen boundaries instead of extending horizontally
  * Restored coaching cards to always be visible (reversed previous hiding behavior)
  * Resized microphone button from 60x60px to 50x50px for better proportion
  * Changed microphone icon color from white to gray (#666666) and reduced icon size to 20px
  * Added plus button next to date text for creating new journal entries
  * Plus button triggers createNewEntry() function with haptic feedback
  * Styled as minimal icon without background or border

- Switched `screens/CoachingScreen.tsx` from `useAudioTranscriptionAv` (expo-av) to `useAudioTranscription` (expo-audio) to enable real-time microphone input metering for the recording indicator. No UI changes, only hook swap. The `AudioLevelIndicator` now reflects actual levels via `recorderState.metering` with normalization and graceful fallback.

- Fixed keyboard behavior in CoachingScreen: When the text input is focused and user starts voice recording, the keyboard now stays open instead of dismissing. Applied to `handleMicrophonePress`, `handleRecordingCancel`, and `handleRecordingConfirm` functions using `isChatInputFocused` state and delayed focus restoration.

- Implemented onboarding progress persistence with AsyncStorage:
  * Created `hooks/useOnboardingProgress.ts` to manage onboarding state persistence
  * Updated `screens/auth/Onboarding.tsx` to save progress on each step and restore on app restart
  * Updated `screens/auth/OnboardingChatScreen.tsx` to clear progress when onboarding completes
  * Updated `navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx` to resume onboarding from saved progress
  * Users can now exit the app during onboarding and resume from where they left off
  * Progress includes: currentStep, name, selectedRoles, selectedSelfReflection, clarityLevel, stressLevel, coachingStylePosition, timeDuration, and interaction states


- **Enhanced Message Scrolling System in OnboardingChatScreen**: Copied advanced message positioning and scrolling logic from CoachingScreen to OnboardingChatScreen:
  * Implemented powerful message positioning system with dynamic content height calculation
  * Added smart scroll management with user scroll detection and auto-positioning
  * Added scroll-to-bottom button that appears when AI responses complete and user scrolls up
  * Added performance optimizations with useMemo for dynamic calculations
  * User messages now position 20px below header for optimal visibility

- **Improved Input Box Handling in OnboardingChatScreen**: Updated input system to match CoachingScreen's advanced functionality:
  * TextInput now completely hides (renders null) during voice recording
  * Added intelligent keyboard focus management - preserves and restores focus during recording
  * Implemented SpinningAnimation during transcription phase
  * Added clean recording UI with audio level indicator and cancel/confirm buttons
  * Switched from `useAudioTranscriptionAv` to `useAudioTranscription` for real-time audio level metering

- **Enhanced UI Components**: 
  * Added AnimatedTypingIndicator with 3-dot animation for AI response loading states
  * Improved AudioLevelIndicator with 6-dot real-time visualization during recording
  * Added scroll-to-bottom button with proper styling and positioning
  * Updated loading message containers with fixed heights for smooth animations

- **Fixed Onboarding Completion Flow**: Updated OnboardingChatScreen completion behavior:
  * "View Compass Results" button now properly completes onboarding process by calling `completeOnboarding()`
  * Added loading state to completion button to prevent double-taps
  * Button shows "Completing..." text during onboarding completion process
  * Ensures user is marked as onboarding complete in Firebase and AsyncStorage is cleared

- **Fixed Enter App Button Persistence**: Resolved issue where Enter App button would disappear after appearing:
  * Added `hasReached100` state to track when progress reaches 100%
  * Enter App button now stays visible permanently once progress reaches 100%
  * Added progress bar safety with Math.min to prevent values exceeding 100%
  * Added debug logging for progress tracking

- **Ensured Premium Bypass for Initial Compass Access**: Enhanced CompassStoryScreen to properly bypass premium requirements for onboarding:
  * Added detailed debug logging when `fromOnboarding: true` parameter is passed
  * Confirmed premium paywall is bypassed for first-time compass access after deep dive
  * Users can view their initial compass results without premium subscription requirement

- **Fixed Meditation Screen Exit Behavior**: Corrected navigation logic when user exits app during meditation:
  * Updated `canNavigateToChat()` function in `hooks/useOnboardingProgress.ts` to properly handle step 15 (meditation preparation screen)
  * Removed incorrect logic that allowed navigation to main app when onboarding steps were completed but onboarding wasn't officially finished
  * Now only allows chat navigation for step 17 (OnboardingChat) or when `completedAt` timestamp exists
  * Fixed issue where exiting during meditation would redirect to home screen instead of returning to step 15 (meditation preparation)
  * Users now properly resume from meditation preparation screen (step 15) when they exit during meditation, allowing them to restart meditation process
