  * **Result**: Eliminated performance degradation and infinite loops, improved analytics reliability with proper React hooks patterns

- **Fixed Onboarding Completion Loop**: Resolved critical issue where completed onboarding would restart life deep dive:
  * **Root Cause Analysis**: OnboardingChatScreen was saving progress on component unmount even after successful onboarding completion
    - User completes life deep dive ‚Üí `handleEnterApp()` ‚Üí onboarding completion ‚úÖ
    - AsyncStorage cleared ‚Üí `üóëÔ∏è Cleared onboarding progress` ‚úÖ
    - Firebase updated ‚Üí `needsOnboarding: false, onboardingCompleted: true` ‚úÖ
    - BUT component unmount cleanup ‚Üí `üíæ Saved onboarding progress: {currentStep: 17}` ‚ùå
    - Next app start ‚Üí Found progress ‚Üí Redirected to OnboardingChat again ‚ùå
  * **Solution Implemented**: 
    - Added `isOnboardingCompleted` state and `isOnboardingCompletedRef` useRef for closure-safe tracking
    - Enhanced `handleEnterApp()` to mark completion before navigation: `setIsOnboardingCompleted(true)` + `isOnboardingCompletedRef.current = true`
    - Modified unmount useEffect cleanup to check completion status before saving progress
    - Added safeguard: `if (isOnboardingCompletedRef.current) { skip progress save }`
  * **Technical Details**:
    - Used useRef pattern to avoid stale closure issues in useEffect cleanup with empty dependencies
    - Maintained proper React hooks patterns while preventing unwanted side effects
    - Added comprehensive logging for debugging onboarding completion flow
  * **Result**: Clean onboarding completion ‚Üí no progress saved on unmount ‚Üí no false resume ‚Üí direct home screen access after life deep dive completion

- **Fixed PostHog Analytics Spam**: Eliminated excessive user_signed_in event tracking that was flooding analytics:
  * **Problem Identified**: `user_signed_in` event was being tracked multiple times per session on every Firebase auth state change
    - Every Firebase auth state update ‚Üí `initializeUserDocument()` ‚Üí `trackSignIn()` call
    - Same user session producing 5-10+ duplicate analytics events
    - PostHog dashboard polluted with redundant sign-in data
    - Analytics data accuracy compromised by false engagement metrics
  * **Solution Implemented**: 
    - Added session-based tracking with `lastTrackedUserIdRef` to prevent duplicate events
    - Enhanced tracking logic: `if (!hasAlreadyTrackedThisUser) { track() }` pattern
    - Session tracking state: Mark user as tracked once per app session
    - Logout state cleanup: Reset `lastTrackedUserIdRef.current = null` on user sign-out
    - Smart logging: Added "(session-once)" markers and "already tracked" skip messages
  * **Technical Implementation**:
    - Used `useRef` for session-persistent tracking state across auth state changes
    - Maintained proper lifecycle: Track on first auth ‚Üí Skip subsequent ‚Üí Reset on logout ‚Üí Track next user
    - Preserved all tracking functionality while eliminating spam
    - Added comprehensive logging for tracking decisions and skips
  * **Result**: Clean analytics flow ‚Üí One sign-in event per user per session ‚Üí Accurate PostHog metrics ‚Üí No tracking spam
